# computervisionAI

Weekend Project for Encode Club AI Bootcamp. We will create a new application from scratch using NextJS and a page with a single input field for the user to upload an image (I.E. a picture from an animal).
We will add a button to upload the image.
Use a Computer Vision model to detect and classify the animal

    The model should be able to detect at least 10 different animals of your choice
    The model should return the name of the animal detected (classification)

Additionally, if possible:  

Create an AI Agent that can find a page in Wikipedia with the name of the animal, retrieve the description, and determine if the animal is dangerous
If the uploaded image contains an animal, pass the image to the AI Agent and await the answer
Display the answer on the page, indicating whether the animal in the picture is dangerous
